    A <b>goose</b> is a bird of any of several waterfowl species in the family Anatidae.
    This group comprises the genera Anser (the grey geese and white geese) and Branta (the black geese).
    <br>
    <br>
    Some other birds, mostly related to the shelducks, have "goose" as part of their names.
    <br>
    <br>
    More distantly related members of the family Anatidae are swans, most of which are larger than true geese, and ducks, which are smaller.
